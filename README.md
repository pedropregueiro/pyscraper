pyscraper
========================================================================================================

What is it?
-----------
This is a very very simple Web scraper

Why?
-----------
I made this to brush up some Python skills

Usage
-----------

TODO
-----------
- analyse response's content type to smartly save as .html, .xml or whatever
- improve display of results
